Homework 2 for CSI 4180 (Word Embeddings)

**Files:**

Report for Homework2.pdf: Required file for submission of the assignment. Not needed for running the program.

Tweets.csv: This file contains many tweets about airlines with sentiment labels. It is necessary for text classification. The code will not run without this file.

homeworkTwo.py: This file contains all of my code. Instructions to run it can be found below

**Instructions for running homeworkTwo.py:**

I have provided a sample command that can be used to run this program below

Example Command:

python3 homeworkTwo.py

Note: No command line arguments will be accepted. Also, you must have the following packages installed: nltk, datasets, scipy, numpy, sklearn, wefe, pandas, plotly, and gensim. Additionally, it will run very slow because it is loading many things and processing a large dataset.

**Credit to AI:**

I utilized GitHub Copilot to assist me. In homeworkTwo.py, there is a comment that gives credit to AI. I used this tool to write the function "convert_gensim_to_wefe_model", and I also used it to optimize the code that I already had written for section 2.4.
